# CRM Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention for FLO, an online shoe retailer. The project includes:

1. **RFM Analysis**: Segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values).
2. **CLTV Prediction**: Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using advanced statistical models (BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma).

The outputs of the project enable FLO to:
- Identify high-value customer segments.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies.
- Forecast potential revenue from existing customers.

## Business Problem
FLO wants to improve its sales and marketing strategies by segmenting its customers and predicting the potential value they may bring in the future. The project aims to:
- Understand customer purchasing behaviors.
- Identify the most valuable customer segments.
- Estimate the future revenue potential of each customer using CLTV models.

## Dataset Information
The datasets used in this project are derived from FLOâ€™s historical transaction records from 2020 to 2021. Key features include:

- **master_id**: Unique customer ID.
- **order_channel**: Channel used for purchases (e.g., Android, iOS, Desktop).
- **first_order_date**: Date of the first purchase.
- **last_order_date**: Date of the most recent purchase.
- **order_num_total_ever_online**: Total number of online purchases.
- **order_num_total_ever_offline**: Total number of offline purchases.
- **customer_value_total_ever_online**: Total spending on online purchases.
- **customer_value_total_ever_offline**: Total spending on offline purchases.
- **interested_in_categories_12**: Categories the customer was interested in over the last 12 months.

## Project Tasks

### RFM Analysis
1. Compute **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** metrics for each customer.
2. Assign RFM scores to customers using a 1-5 scale.
3. Create customer segments based on RFM scores.
4. Analyze the average metrics and behavior of each segment.

### CLTV Prediction
1. Preprocess the data:
   - Handle outliers in `order_num_total` and `customer_value_total`.
   - Combine online and offline purchase data into unified metrics.
2. Calculate weekly metrics for **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** values.
3. Fit the **BG-NBD** model to estimate the number of future transactions.
4. Fit the **Gamma-Gamma** model to predict the average transaction value.
5. Predict 6-month CLTV for each customer and segment customers into four groups.
6. Generate actionable insights and recommendations for marketing strategies.


## Results

### RFM Analysis
The RFM analysis identified key customer segments, such as:
- **Champions**: High-value customers with frequent and recent purchases.
- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who purchase regularly but may have lower spending.
- **At Risk**: Customers with declining activity who need targeted reactivation campaigns.
- **Hibernating**: Inactive customers who may require incentivization to return.

### CLTV Prediction
- Predicted 6-month CLTV for each customer using the BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma models.
- Segmented customers into four groups (A, B, C, D) based on their CLTV values.
- Recommended strategies for retaining high-value customers and reactivating at-risk customers.
